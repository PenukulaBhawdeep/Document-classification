# Document-classification

*Overview*
This project aims to classify documents into predefined categories such as emails, resumes, scientific papers, and more. It utilizes machine learning techniques to extract meaningful features from text 
and classify documents efficiently.

*Features*


1.Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings

3. Supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models)

4. Fine-tuned deep learning models including VGG16, ResNet50, CLIP, and GPT-4

5. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

6. Support for PDF, TXT, and other document formats

7.Integration with EasyOCR for text extraction from scanned documents


*Technologies Used:*

1. Python
2. Scikit-learn
3. TensorFlow/PyTorch
4. Pandas & NumPy
5. NLTK / SpaCy for NLP processing
6. EasyOCR for text extraction
7. Flask / FastAPI (if deploying as an API)
8. VGG16, ResNet50, CLIP, and GPT-4 for document classification
